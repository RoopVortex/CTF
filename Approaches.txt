1. Chatgpt showed right approach but did the calculations wrong. Re-did it myself to come to the answer.
2. Saw the frames and video multiple times. Compared the video with that of youtube. Learnt things like rickrolling, even understood morse code. Finally found the answer in the Properties comment. 
4. ELF format can be easily be viewed in Linux or Kali Linux, unable to do it in Windows. CTF{} was present inside the file. Did a lot of research WLF, many softwares to view elf. But the file got download simply as file in windows, not as elf so....
